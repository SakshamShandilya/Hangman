This is a Python implementation of the classic word-guessing game, Hangman. In this game, the player has to guess a word by guessing individual letters in a limited number of attempts. The game features an interactive console-based user interface and a library of common words to play with.

## How to Play
1.Run hangman.py in your Python environment.

2.The computer will randomly select a word for you to guess.

3.Guess letters one at a time by typing them on the command line.

4.If you guess a correct letter, it will be revealed in the word.

5.If you guess an incorrect letter, a part of the hangman is drawn on the screen.

6.You have 6 incorrect guesses before the game is over.

7.Keep guessing until you either guess the word or run out of guesses.

## Customization
You can customize the game in the following ways:

1.Change the word list: Open the words.txt file and add or remove words as desired.

2.Set the difficulty level: When prompted, choose between easy, medium, and hard difficulty levels.

3.Save your progress: The game automatically saves your progress so you can continue playing later.

## Dependencies
This game requires Python 3.x to run. No additional libraries or packages are required.
